# WorldBuilder API

## App Organization and Terminology
The basis of the application is to create a "world," which is the basest of all classes.  A world is not a planet, rather something like an IP or contained universe with a shared set of rules.  Something like the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be considered a world in the context of this application.

From the creation of the base world, you can create any number of characters, planets, universes, and everything else the app has to offer.

### Character

### Universe

### Galaxy

### Planet

### Country

### Ethnicity
